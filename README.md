ML project with scope for deployment and productionization

This project presents a study on crop growth simulation and advisory support using
a crop prediction dataset. The dataset used for this work was exported from a public
Kaggle dataset. Machine learning models were applied to predict growth patterns.
XGBoost was tested first but Random Forest produced more dependable results. A
simple interface using Tkinter along with Pathlab and Longin was developed. The
study shows that machine learning can help farmers make informed decisions.
Keywords: crop growth, simulation, random forest, agriculture, advisory system

## Future Scope
- Containerize model for deployment
- Expose prediction API
- Deploy on cloud infrastructure
